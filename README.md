# rk.googlesheets4
This package provides a suite of RKWard plugins that create a graphical user interface for the popular `googlesheets4` R package. It is designed to bridge the gap between desktop RKWard sessions and cloud-based Google Sheets, allowing for authentication, reading, writing, and management of sheets without needing to memorize API functions.
